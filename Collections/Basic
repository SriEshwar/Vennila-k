collection
    it is like holder/container
    it is a framework
    group of object

why collection?
    
    in real time example we want to carry different types of things in one place another place 
    one way --> carry one by one
    or    carry container which holds all things
    the 2nd way is easy and time save way



set ------->   duplicate will not allow
               does not maintain order
    hashset
    TreeSet --> for order maintain we will go to tree set

Stack  ----->  data store in last in first out(LIFO)
               transcational history or whatsapp chats

Queue --------> data store in First In First Out (FIFO)
          
Map/Dictionary --->  It is key Value pair

    HashMap
    TreeMap


LIST   
     ArrayList -> It is like array continous memory location
     LinkedList -> It is in Form of Node (previous node + Data +Next node)
